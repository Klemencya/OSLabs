A traditional operating system such as Windows doesn’t deal with deadlock recovery as it is a time and space-consuming process. 
Real-time operating systems use Deadlock recovery. 

Killing the process – 
Killing all the processes involved in the deadlock. Killing process one by one.
After killing each process check for deadlock again keep repeating the process till the system recovers from deadlock. 
Killing all the processes one by one helps a system to break circular wait condition.

Resource Preemption – 
Resources are preempted from the processes involved in the deadlock, preempted resources are allocated to other processes 
so that there is a possibility of recovering the system from deadlock. In this case, the system goes into starvation.

We can prevent Deadlock by eliminating any of the above four conditions: Eliminate Mutual Exclusion, Eliminate Hold and wait, 
Eliminate No Preemption,  Eliminate Circular Wait.
Deadlock avoidance can be done with Banker’s Algorithm. 

Deadlock prevention is more strict than Deadlock Avoidance.
